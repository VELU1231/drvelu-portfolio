# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js has revolutionized how we build React applications. In this guide, I'll walk you through the basics and help you get started with your first Next.js project.

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a powerful React framework that enables you to build full-stack web applications with intuitive features and has excellent developer experience. It provides features like server-side rendering, static generation, API routes, and much more.

## Why Choose Next.js?

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Render pages on the server for better SEO and performance
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Generate static HTML at build time
- **API Routes**: Build API endpoints as serverless functions
- **Image Optimization**: Automatic image optimization for better performance
- **Built-in CSS Support**: Support for CSS modules and global styles

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16 or later
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

Create a new Next.js app using the official create-next-app CLI:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

A typical Next.js project structure looks like this:

```
my-app/
├── app/
│   ├── layout.tsx       # Root layout
│   ├── page.tsx         # Home page
│   └── api/             # API routes
├── public/              # Static assets
├── lib/                 # Utility functions
├── components/          # React components
└── package.json
```

## Creating Your First Page

Next.js uses file-based routing. Create a new file in the `app` directory:

```tsx
// app/about/page.tsx
export default function About() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>This is the about page</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Now you can access this page at `/about`.

## Building an API Route

Create an API route to handle HTTP requests:

```tsx
// app/api/hello/route.ts
export async function GET(request: Request) {
  return Response.json({ message: 'Hello from Next.js!' })
}
```

## Conclusion

Next.js provides a fantastic foundation for building modern web applications. With its built-in optimizations and developer-friendly features, you can focus on building great user experiences.

Happy coding!
